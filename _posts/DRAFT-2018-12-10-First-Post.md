# Outline

The girls are experiments. Each created to test a specific hypothesis the Professor wanted to answer. He could not enclose them in a lab for monitoring. The data gathered would be too limited for anything meaningful. He needed to gather data on them in the open world, to yield promising results. With the largest conglomerate entity at his finger tips, he set up a system that’ll monitor the girls, at every moment of their lives. Only then he’ll be able to put forth his answers.

Some say he has somewhat a controlling charisma.

### Mayor of TSV Megalopis:
A charismatic speaker that advocates the use of technology to expand city infracture, public ultility. and safety. Rapid growth of these expansions over the years had lead to a population boom to what is now knowm as TSV Megalopolis.

### Mojo Jojo (shorten to Jojo, may need to change):

### Grinders (Represents Gangreene Gang):

The process of induction for new members is done by completing extremely difficult tasks to the point of suicide of martyrdom status. This is the only way members can show that they truly believe they are to be accepted. The tasks makes it almost a certainty these new members return with life threatening wounds and missing limbs. Some do not return, leaving abandonment or death as the only valid assumptions. Once accepted, members are administered a secret injection, not known to the outside, that’ll force their body to regenerate damage parts, but the healing process leaves the affect area with green pigment. Some members try to improve themselves with body parts of anyone they want, most times by force. 

### SeDuSa Poly-Services (May need to change):

Titillating company involved in media/escort services/merchandising that hires "self-employed" operators found through recruitment and word of mouth. It is a wonder how well a company can do when they save in advertisement. Recruits are of many walks and demographics, but the young and youthful are the most employed in marketing and merchandising.

Street saying goes, they treat their employees like their markets, indiscriminately.

A small private military company mostly consisting of female mercenaries, soldiers, and spies. Participants gathered are not conditioned with training for the first month, but are instead administered scheduled chemical injections. These injections adjust the body for combat and strenuous training routine to come. But this has the side effect of leaving them becoming addicted and thus dependent on the injections. Very few girls ever decide to leave, and when they do, the withdraws leave them with high levels of neuroticism than the normal.  Limited reporting of the side effects mentions paranoia, fear, self-doubt, depression as effects. Medical case show this leaves them almost incapable of maintaining their now lost lives. But the company denies this. Men are also contracted, but as fodder/infantry and headcount padding.
