blossom tries to disable a man by purposely shooting a guy's leg right from under him. he falls forward with one arm bracing for impact while the other surprises blossoms sending shots down towards down in. buttercup saves blossom, and berates her for being a terrible shot. blossoms feels self-conscious for holding back.

buttercup and blossoms finds a experiment weapon that buttercup heard about once from a internal leak from within HIM corp. all information surrounding it was scrubbed right from the net. no one had a copy, and the ones that did went missing. it was designed with an experimental brain-machine interface to give, whoever landed their shots, positive feedback. the feeling was described as "euphoric" in the leak. but here one make of it was found off the corpse of a gang member. status screen on the side of the weapon read "Despond".

Paragraph

[Plot hole: Why wasn't {{Buttercup}} found in a prison instead? This can be explained by a combination of {{Bubbles}} convincing {{Blossom}} to release and take care of her]

>Nurse 1: You're going to jail, you know that?

>{{Buttercup}}: What other news is there?

>Nurse 2: I can tell you that you'll be going there for a long time. Trying to steal from a government-back corporation got you nailed.

>Nurse 1: You're going to get trialed for terrorism for failing to steal whatever it was you had.

>{{Buttercup}} Failing? That's funny way to put it.

>Nurse 2: You shouldn't have failed. Simple. We gotta move you done to the lobby
