[Plot hole: Why wasn't {{Buttercup}} found in a prison instead? This can be explained by a combination of {{Bubbles}} convincing {{Blossom}} to release and take care of her]

>Nurse 1: You're going to jail, you know that?

>{{Buttercup}}: What other news is there?

>Nurse 1: You're going to get trialed for terrorism for failing to steal whatever it was you had.

>{{Buttercup}} Failing? That's funny way to put it.

>Nurse 2: You shouldn't have failed. Simple. We gotta move you done to the lobby
