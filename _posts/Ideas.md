coma, hack, dimension theory - story takes place in the false worlds after reawakening from a coma, restore from hack, reemerge from the rift. this makes the setting progressively weirder

blossom tries to disable a man by purposely shooting a guy's leg right from under him. he falls forward with one arm bracing for impact while the other surprises blossoms sending shots down towards down in. buttercup saves blossom, and berates her for being a terrible shot. blossoms feels self-conscious for holding back.

buttercup and blossoms finds a experiment weapon that buttercup heard about once from a internal leak from within HIM corp. all information surrounding it was scrubbed right from the net. no one had a copy, and the ones that did went missing. it was designed with an experimental brain-machine interface to give, whoever landed their shots, positive feedback. the feeling was described as "euphoric" in the leak. but here one make of it was found off the corpse of a gang member. status screen on the side of the weapon read "Despond".  (sniper, the arbiter gun - exultant protocol - good performance: exult and enhance user performance.  - despondent protocol - bad performance: despond and discourage the user.)

Paragraph

[Plot hole: Why wasn't {{Buttercup}} found in a prison instead? This can be explained by a combination of {{Bubbles}} convincing {{Blossom}} to release and take care of her]

>Nurse 1: You're going to jail, you know that?

>{{Buttercup}}: What other news is there?

>Nurse 2: I can tell you that you'll be going there for a long time. Trying to steal from a government-back corporation got you nailed.

>Nurse 1: You're going to get trialed for terrorism for failing to steal whatever it was you had.

>{{Buttercup}} Failing? That's funny way to put it.

>Nurse 2: You shouldn't have failed. Simple. We gotta move you done to the lobby

Blossom was made from a failed test candidate. Her mother was meant to test the viability of inducing inate telekinesis by isolating specific genes found from Mitochondrial Lilith through selective multi-generational breeding. Unlike her offerspring, she failed to show any effects of the ability as did those who were tested before her. She died during the final stages of the test, her eggs were immediatory stored. Some of these eggs past preliminary screening but one of them proved viable. The professor bought the research company, Bellum, that conducted the 60 some year experiment, of which Sasha Bellum being the lastest head of the company. She is the great great grand daught of Sara Bellum, whom was admitted into an asylum for insanity. She hallucinated for the rest of her lifeÂ  and died via suicide. Some internal rumors from the Bellum suggest initial testings she conducted induced her psychosis.

bubbles born from an iniative between the professor and H.I.M. Corp. the professor provided h.i.m. with the funs as investment, while h.i.m. took this to conduction their own research into several projects. the professor picked one he saw most interesting to experiment with first, which was an extremely experimental bio-meta-materials developed h.i.m,'s AI., that was an analogue of stem cells. internally called mimic material, the professor use this to develop batches of embryos. but only one proved viable. 

buttercup born from a relationship the professor and vyolet greene. the first to be born from her womb. she's a researcher who worked in one of the medical companies in owned by him. she lead the development that made many medical breakthroughs kept interally. her rapid succuess caught the attention of the professor, who found interest in not only her research. yet this love was not long lived, vyolet made herself became sick from stress and overwork. she stopped developing in her research and all projects headed by her were paused. professor took care of her, she got better, they decide to have kids, but both being scientist, used their research to create embryos to which led to the girls. her research went into what made buttercups embryo. Research into sythetic blood plasma and blood production. All bones in the body would be classified as red marrow, which produces this enchanced blood, at an heighted rate. The blood becomes extraordinarily efficent in all task compared to ordinary blood. Vyolent had done further research to replicate metamorphic efect that butterflies exhibit. Material made from her research will disolve into a cocoon like structure to "re-emerge" in the form of the original before metamorphosis, only after severe damage.

bubbles is esports player. she tops the charts in most esport games. but she never identify herself. uses a male pseudonym, and masks her voice in voice chats.

some character had their arms replaced due to birth defect. doctor told them they need to exercise enough to keep up with their arms. but parents must upgrade his arms ever so often to keep with with body growth. it became costly and parents lost everything to keep up with the payments. one died, the other abandon the child. kid never got the final upgrade for adult hood. kid managed to get the upgrade, but the quality was awful. so they spend their time improving the arms.

episodic stories that examples the world and how the girls operate within it. 

what goes down when they worked together for the first time? the missions is a success, not without someone getting hurt. blossom gets hurts and bubbles. bubbles was forced to be present for the job to work. she gets a glimps of who they stole from. the data was meant to go straight to H.I.M.'s corporate, but was intercepted last minute. bubbles was shocked by the console through feedback

The professor originally wanted to help solve a hereditary birth defect that made new born babies female. He thought to genetically engineer baby boys whose DNA would counteract the affects. He was blind sided, however he overlooked a crucile component in the process. The babies were all born with the same defect, all female. Their surrogate mother, the love of his life, had the dormant gene. Her secret doomed his research, but she died after their birth. He didn't want to raise them because of his grief, so a put them out into the world, and watches them from afar. [End sentence could be different. Maybe they were attacked, and everyone was scattered]

Bubbles body dysmorphic disorder. Similar feelings to cisgender vs transgender. Converses with a transgender person about the feeling of being in the wrong body. But conflict arises

Brassica creates sleeper agents that hide inside the body of a oblivious carriers. Agents mimic/copy the genetic signature of the host to stay hidden. Once they are at their objective, they violently split off from the host and attack. These agents are known as Chimeras. They get their information from what the host digest, the food that Brassica give away. Multiple Chimeras can inhabit a host. They are extremely slender but deadly and can grow in size through consumption, usually eating the host victim.

Experiment data leading up to their both is stored in the girls DNA.
