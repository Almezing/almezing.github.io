# Outline

The girls are experiments. Each created to test a specific hypothesis the Professor wanted to answer. He could not enclose them in a lab for monitoring. The data gathered would be too limited for anything meaningful. He needed to gather data on them in the open world, to yield promising results. With the largest conglomerate entity at his finger tips, he set up a system that’ll monitor the girls, at every moment of their lives. Only then he’ll be able to put forth his answers.

### Gangrene Gang (may just be Greene Gang):

This is the only way members can show that they truly believe they are to be accepted. This task makes it almost a certainty these new members returning with life threatening wounds and missing limbs. Some do not return, leaving abandonment or death as the only valid assumptions. Once accepted, members are administered a secret injection, not known to the outside, that’ll force their body to regenerate damage parts, but the healing process leaves the affect area with green pigment. 
        
### SeDuSa Poly-Services (May need to change):

Titillating company involved in media/escort services/merchandising that hires "self-employed" operators found through recruitment and word of mouth.
