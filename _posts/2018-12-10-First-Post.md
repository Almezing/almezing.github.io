The girls are experiments. Each created to test a specific hypothesis the Professor wanted to answer. He could not enclose them in a lab for monitoring. The data gathered would be too limited for anything meaningful. He needed to gather data on them in the open world, to yield promising results. With the largest conglomerate entity at his finger types, he set up a system that’ll monitor the girls, at every moment of their lives. Only then he’ll be able to put forth his answers. 
# Characters of TSV Megalopolis

### Professor Utonium (Plutonium is element 94. Indium is element 49. V-indium): 
A scientist whose success in various research topic led to him becoming the CEO of his conglomerate, Utonium Industries Group (Vindium Industries Group, which operates in healthcare, pharmaceuticals, food production and services, technical and urban infrastructure, and education. Being in a powerful position, he manages his empire with a conclave of confidants, but is very involved in some minor management at rungs of the the conglomerate later. Some say he has somewhat a controlling charisma.

### Mojo Jojo (shorten to Jojo, may need to change):
Another of Professor Secret experiments that demonstrated how increasing higher intelligence in non-human primates can be achieved. Due to his fear that he may underestimate Mojo Jojo’s, the professor closely monitors him, doing it with a caring fatherly facade. Replaces the Professor with a copy to continue running the company. Extremely limited amount of personnel have seen him, but the rumors say he is very sophisticated. He continues the Professor’s experiments and even conducts his own.

### Gangrene Gang (may just be Greene Gang):
Auto-Biohacking group consisting of zealous members. The process of induction for new members is by completing extremely difficult tasks to the point of suicide of martyrdom status. This is the only way members can show that they truly believe they are to be accepted. This also almost guarantee these new members returning with live threatening wounds and missing limbs or a show no with abandonment or death as the only valid assumptions. Once accepted, members are administered a secret injection, not know to the outside, that’ll force their body to generate damage parts, but the healing process leaves the affect area in a green pigment. 
        
### SeDuSa Poly-Services (May need to change):

Titillating company involved in media/escort services/merchandising that hires "self-employed" operators found through recruitment and word of mouth. It is a wonder how well a company when they save in advertisement. Recruits are of many walks and demographics, but the young and youthful are employed in marketing and merchandising. The company strictly follows labor laws, however there is the occasional legal mishaps that they lawyer tackles yearly. Street saying goes, they treat their employees like their markets, indiscriminately.

### Creations by H.I.M. (Heavy Infantry Manufacturing):

Global Manufacturer of firearms, ammunitions, and hardware. Known for its unmatched high military grade equipment, they a contracted by government entities, NGO’s, PMCs, and other companies in industries in security and finances. Even they even individual orders. This allows HIM to maintain a high budget for research and manufacturing in advancing its edge and providing its high standards. Slogan: "With Man's Perfect Creation, Nothing is Equal to Him"

### Femme Fatale Co. (Could just be Fatale Co.):

A Small private military company mostly consisting of female mercenaries, soldiers, and spies. Participants gathered are not conditioned with training for the first month, but are instead administered scheduled chemical injections. These injections adjust the body for combat and strenuous training routine to come. But this has the side effect of leaving them becoming addicted and thus dependent on the injections. Very Few girls ever decide to leave, and when they do, the withdraws leave them with high levels of neuroticism than the normal.  Limited reporting of the side effects mentions paranoia, fear, self-doubt, depression as effects. Medical case show this leaves them almost incapable of maintaining their now lost lives. But the company denies this. Men are also contracted, but as fodder/infantry and headcount padding. 

### Professor Lumpkins (May need to change):

Professor Lumpkins, also known as "Fuzzy" by his colleagues and students, is a researcher working in agriculture and food processing trying to find solutions to reducing greenhouse gas productions, food alternatives, and mass hunger that is rampant in the world. He stumbles on one possible solution that led to him to becoming hysteric in how he described it as "effective and efficient" to solving all three problems.

### AmIba Securities and Informatics (Represents the Amoeba Boys. Works with Abracavader):

One of the largest securities company after a merger between AMPM Secured and Iba Informatics, AmIba employs millions across the global to provide services to various industries and thousands of companies. It's a wonder how the company continue to employ and operate as worker casualty remains at a worryingly high amount every year. It was rumored that Dr. Abrahm Cadavera, a researcher in bio-necrology, virology, and biome processing, in is heavily the company's employee retention program.

### The Brassica Foundation (The Broccoloid Aliens):

Mysterious group. Philanthropic and care for the needy by providing with food and some resources.

# The Girls - B to V
### Buttercup ({{Buttercup}})  
Alias: Green Machine
Associations - Gangrene Gang (associate from interaction that later resulted in her receive the inject, allow for fast recovery from any attack)
Powers: Strength, Speed, Regeneration
Concept based off Akali (LoL), Faith (Mirrors Edge) , Tifa (FFVII) 

> That last fight was bust. It did not end well for the both of us. It ended up a loss for me by shitty ruling, but he ended up in a coma anyways. Should have never accepted his offer, but whatever these people wanted a show, and best of all, they know my name.

{{ Buttercup }} has a rough personality, not liked by many, but alluring or inspiring to others in the underground. She’s an amatuer underground MMA fighter trying to make a name for herself. Her aim is that of fame. Be the best at what she does best: fighting. Because of this singlar aim, {{ Buttercup }} does not put enough effort into other areas of her life. Effectively a degenerate, she scrapes by with the winnings from her matches. She would swallow her pride and bet against herself to get by so she’ll fight another match. But as it is her tradition, she’ll mostly spends her earnings on drugs and alcohol. Constantly at the end of her rope, {{ Buttercup }} lives her life, one fight at a time.

### Bubbles ({{Bubbles}}) - alias: CyberVyrus Support Class
Associations - HIM (association stems from a unique interface to properly integration HIM technology)
Powers: Technomancy, Augmentation 
Concept based off of Hatsune Miku, Jinx (LoL)

>We’re a full team. 2 fighters, 2 tanks, and a healer which is me. I hate it when the system sets it up like this. Very unfair. The other team will have a hay day with us.

>“Lets win ths 1”

>“O boy, a bunch of randos”

>“Rember 2 rez us”

> They always start the game this way as if what they say mattered. It only means something if we win. Never it meant anything when we lose. But I always start my games with 

>“Good Luck. Have Fun “

{{Bubbles}} was found in a basket, but without limbs. Because of this physical limitation, {{Bubbles}} is forced to live a sheltered life, unable to perform semi-abled-body functions. She learns from educational videos, news streams, and other media sources that is available. Her guardians also provides her with information on the world while keeping {{Bubbles}} alive. It was when her guardians find at the doorstep an unusual package shipped to {{Bubbles}}. Inside were robotic limbs that were meant to connect to Bubbles’ metallic receptors of where limbs would be. Although, {{Bubbles}} was no longer physically limited in exploring the world, she herself was  her own restraint to ever venture out. She would not go out beyond the home she grew up in, as she had found comfort in her use of the internet connect world she is all too familiar of. Online is where her presence is strong, and where she now earns a living in cyber warfare. 

### {{Bubbles}} V2

{{Bubbles}} grew up like any other kid in the crowded neighborhoods of TSV Megalopolis, or she'd had hoped. She played and ran with the other kids, until the accident. It's hardly a tragedy a kid would get hurt or even killed in the high speed disorder of the city. The accident happened too fast for anyone to remember who was involved, but people were left wondering. The report on the news the next day had found no body, but only an arm and a leg that only suggest they came from a child. {{Bubbles}} watched the news report while fidgeting with the silky and polished arm as the shine from the TV glistened upon it. Left traumatized and ashamed, she dared not go out beyond the home she grew up in. Eventually, {{Bubbles}} grew a stronger presence in the net connected world, where she earns a living in cyber warfare.

Blossom ({{Blossom}}) - alias: Best Girl 
Associations - Sedusa (association stems from that fact that she takes up jobs to make extra money, and gained a network of trust)
Powers: Psychic, Espionage
Concept based of off Aloy (Horizon Zero Dawn), Ygritte (GoT)

> The alarm is going to hit 5:30 soon. I have to get up for the run. It takes me 28 minutes to finish 3 minutes to get back into my room, 15 to wash up and another 15 to get ready for the haul to get to work. I can do things better to get a better time, but that’ll be another day to test. This routine works well enough. This week is where the new patients are sent in. I kind of like seeing the new faces. Gives me something to look forward to. I already have this month covered, but with the new pay installment also coming in, I might have to do that job again to cover the cost. She deserve to see another day. The alarm is about to go off. 

{{Blossom}} lives a life where she’s better off than most. She puts effort into her line of work and is respected by most of her colleagues. Being the what everyone calls her, the “best girl”, she excels at her tasks. But she does so at a cost. Although {{Blossom}} performs above and beyond her line of work, she is financially burdened to the point of ruin. This is because of the sick and quite nearly dying guardian {{Blossom}} feels compelled to care for. {{Blossom}} obligates herself with this filial responsibility out of respect her guardian took care of her during her time growing up. However, she understands that to meet the medical cost she’ll need to gather resources though other, non-reputable means. Through these trials and her honor, {{Blossom}} struggles to fulfills a growing debt.

# Outline v2

The girls are experiments. Designer babies created to test a specific hypothesis the Professor wanted to answer: what makes the perfect little girl. He could not enclose them in a lab for monitoring. The data gathered would be too limited for anything meaningful. He needed to gather data on them in the open world, to yield promising results. With the largest conglomerate entity at his fingertips, he set up a system that’ll monitor the girls, at every moment of their lives. Only then he’ll be able to put forth his answers. The professor places each infant girl at the doorstep of strangers at selected parts of TSV Megalopolis. Fast forward into the lives of the girls, they are now working adults and living like everyone else around, them ignorant of their purposes. 

{{Buttercup}} gets by as an underground fighter, where her winnings sustain her style of degeneracy, partying and drinking like there's no tomorrow. But not lost without hope she believes there is a something worth fighting for. Vain as it may, her aim is to be the squaring off with champions, always believe she's just a few matches away from stardom. Career driven she may seem, {{Buttercup}} holds no candle to {{Blossom}}'s ambitions. 

{{Blossoms}} had what most would consider an enviable childhood. She grew up in the better section of the city, went to the well funded schools, and works the respectable jobs. As normal her live sounds, it is far from her reality. {{Blossom}} take on these jobs for the sole purpose of her guardian's medical bills, or so she thinks. Slaving away the rest of her life to do right by the person who ensured her her childhood, {{Blossom}} doesn’t think twice of what must be done. She understands her honor can be betrayed, but her moral choices are not easily swayed. Which is more than what can be said for {{Bubbles}}.

### {{Bubbles}} V1

{{Bubbles}}, growing up, developed a few mental. disorders but not what the professor designed. It was the implication of his experiment, as {{Bubbles}} was found by her guardian without limbs. By only removing her limbs and grafting bio-mechanic receptors, the professor gave way to replacement limbs. Once in while the professor anonymously ships limbs, to coincide the {{Bubbles}} growth rate. But {{Bubbles}} could not see herself as a normal child growing up. She grew distant, antisocial, and ultimately emotionally depressed. She finds console in her guardian, which is a joy in rare moments. In those absent times, Bubbles immerses herself in the net world where is her ventures brought her employment as a hacker for hire. But depression still lingers.

### {{Bubbles}} V2

{{Bubbles}}, growing up, developed a few mental. disorders but not what the professor designed. It was the implication of his experiment, as it is the reason {{Bubbles}} is living today. She does not understand it herself, but body perseveres through metallic adaptation and becomes further resilient to damage. This left {{Bubbles}} unable to cope, her not seeing herself as a normal child growing up. She grew distant, antisocial, and ultimately emotionally depressed. She finds console in her guardian, which is a joy at rare moments. In those absent times, {{Bubbles}} immerses herself in the net world where is her ventures brought her employment as a hacker for hire. But depression still lingers.

The girls live their lives unaware of one another’s existence. They struggle with the problem of life in their own way, dictated by TVS Megalopolis, as do the rest of the denizen of the city. Gang wars, information trade, murders, hack jobs and botch jobs are just a taste of what the city offers. Through some series of events, the girls found each other. Through these interactions, they discover from one another more of themselves than just being in the same company and mutual cooperation. They share similar birth circumstances, age, name, and even the lingering question of where they've come from. Their friendship have led them to doing various underground jobs that are always available to do in TVS Megalopolis. Their work was getting them noticed for hits with higher risk and higher payouts.

A high steaks job came in one night, at least that's the impression. The informant pushed a lot of money for a deal. To entice or to entrap, the girls weren't sure which but they've dealt with both. Not often these kinds of offers are fronted like that. Information spreads like a virus in the city, and the the only cure is seeing if the girls deliver.


> Mojo sets them up to meet each other and then to meet him - Why? For cloning, but they are not required

# Episodic stories?
# How the girls meet. 

[Starts with {{Buttercup}}'s perspective]

{{Buttercup}} needed extra cash to prepare for her next match that will happen overseas. The plane tickets themselves will run her more than what she saved from previous matches. But this match is the be all and end all of her her underground career that’ll shoot her towards rockstar status or send her spiraling down like a turd in a toilet. She’ll be in  the vanguard team of the operation. The goal? Break into a HIM weapons warehouse to steal developmental schematics and experiment weapons. The hit goes wrong, {{Buttercup}} ends up in the hospital where Blossom works. {{Bubbles}} keeps track on {{Buttercup}} for she feeds responsible for what happened. Hacker is unknown till later.

> {{Buttercup}}: Minimal security, easy break-in points made this hit a done deal according to the contact’s informant. The intel came from a hacker who is joining us to get us by and covering our tracks. I hate relying on some dork behind desk, staring at a screen. I hope his eyes burn from too much exposure after this. Whatever, I’m going to make this a quick job, and get back to training. I’m just at the edge of a new level in the slugging business, but I just need a little bit more money. I’ve gotta make sure this job gets done without a hitch. 

>{{Buttercup}}: Hey hackerman

>{{Bubbles}}: My gender does  not matter”

>{{Buttercup}}: Well you matter now. What’s your guess on this job

>{{Bubbles}}: We have a high likelihood of making out unscathed

>{{Buttercup}}: Says the one sitting behind a trash can

>{{Bubbles}}: This mission depends on our cohesion. We can’t risk our cooperation over petty grudges

>{{Buttercup}}: Who said anything about a grudge. I’m the one literally putting my neck on the line while you get to literally sit, point  and click

>{{Bubbles}}: AmIba security has upped it’s cybersuite packages as of late, and I have not found any workarounds just yet

>{{Buttercup}}: All the more reason for me to make sure I don’t fuck up, and do keep our asses hidden

>{{Bubbles}}: I can assure you, you don’t need to worry. I’ll keep you all safe. Especially you if you like.

>{{Buttercup}}: Sigh. Sure I’ll take your special good luck charm for what it’s worth.

>{{Bubbles}}: I brought you good intel

>{{Buttercup}}: Again, sure

>{{Bubbles}}: I promise

[Will come back to flesh out the parts leading up to the job going wrong. So far it was due to bad intel and underestimation which led to a “trap”]

Vanguard arrived at the point of entry. This side point was found to be the quickest but safest way into where the assets were being held. An entry midway between office area and basement where the other asset is housed and escape route is mapped to the rendezvous point. The facility looked heavily guarded from the outside, but the intel suggest this was only a front and the interior will nearly be empty of patrols. The first assets resides on a computer desk somewhere in the office space. It was sent and stored there about a week ago. It may have been deleted after sitting for so long, but traces of it can be recovered. 

[might name the crew members]

The crew consisted of a ragtag character all trying to make a quick buck. There’s the wanna be gangster, the hot headed bimbo, literally some kid, the usual big guy, and the butch chick. 

[The crew makes their way pass guards to gain the first assets. They make a safe venture to the office space while {{Bubbles}}, with the help of the kid lookout, hack through the facility’s security, and extract the schematic blueprint onto a storage chip. Then they make their way down to the basement. Security got heavier. The crew were nearly caught to make their way down. Their paced need to slow down until getting into where the weapon crate was to be found. They needed to broke through one final down, but minutes later the alarm sounded off. The the sound shocked through the entire crew, defying their expectations. Guard where heard making their way to the area. ]

The job was a disaster. Bullets are flying down the corridor. Some are ricocheting off the security door at the back. AmIba guards must have brought in they’re H.I.M. issued tech just for this hit. All it took was one stray ricocheting into the eye socket of the poor bastard carrying the schematic documents. The crew member slumped back against the wall, loosening his grip on his weapon to use the rest of his final moments to maneuver the memory card out from his coat pocket but his arm went limp, as did his entire body. The chip was snatch by the kid-lookout hiding behind the thin corner that narrows the hallway, where the rest of the vanguard team were locked down.

[Will need to describe the area better]

>Buttercup: You fucked us! You fucking fucked us!

>{{Bubbles}}: I can't be blamed for this

>{{Buttercup}}: Bullshit. You're the one who got us the intel. What kind of hack you even are?

>{{Bubbles}}: I dug for the intel, but from on anonymous tip

>{{Buttercup}}: You took a chance on an anonymous tip!? How can this get any worse with you running your shit scripts.

>{{Bubbles}}: At least we've secured the cargo. All that needs to be done is for ground team to get out of there

>{{Buttercup}}: We're fucked here because of you and expect us to make up for your mistake?

>{{Bubbles}}: Give me time......The security door should be open

>{{Buttercup}}: But that’s where we came from!

>{{Bubbles}}: I know. I am going to route you guys a way out, and block access to any pursuing guards.

>{{Buttercup}}: How can I even trust you!?

>{{Bubbles}}: Became I promised.

The full-metal security doors instantly sprung open into the short corridor leading back to storage. It is certainly not the best escape route, as demonstrated by another crew member designated to carrying the large experimental weapon crate. He made a bad gamble when noticing the AmIba guards was on break for a reload, but he followed up too late. He took a shot in the arm holding the crate. The dropped crate was hardly audible in the orchestra of gunfire. He was already sluggish for being the brawny build in the bunch, but lucky enough he managed to get to a safe spot in storage, behind the shelves of containers. A second member was shot down in her attempt to get pass the security doors. She would have had a chance if she took 3 shots less to her shoulder blades and spine. Her lifeless body skid and rolled past the doors but barely inches besides the weapon crate.

>Brawny member: They fucking got me! I drop the box!

>{{Buttercup}}: We need that for the full payout. I’m not losing money on this bullshit job.

{{Buttercup}} pushes herself into the wall and motions closer the edge but flinches away as streaks of high velocity rounds whiz pass into the storage area, seemingly missing the crate. The guards were likely ordered not to cause any damage to it and were sure to recapture the asset. It maybe worth more than 100 times their annual paychecks combined. After triple guessing himself, the kid-lookout mangled his way towards the storage containers, leaving {{Buttercup}} behind. His goofy attempt got his foot caught on the crate, kicking it up laterally on its narrow side and him smacking the floor. It’s rectangular broadside peered back towards the AmIba guards, partially reflecting their movements. The kid crawled from behind the crate, into storage with a small blood trail from a busted lip. {{Buttercup}} used the same idea to use the crate itself as momentarily cover after sliding flatley behind it.

>{{Buttercup}}: Block them off!

The reverberating slam echoed across the corridor and storage room with the neon exit above brightening up before shorting out. Muffled footsteps, clanking and chatter from the other side suggest the AmIba guards are attempting to force their through the doors. With this break of action, the crew gathered around to assets their situation. 2 members are wiped and 1 and a half are leaking. The brawny member arm didn't get shredded by the AmIba's weapons, even though the shot could have been from a H.I.M weapon. A quick patch up won't hold up from long, but it'll do for the rest of the night. The kid already bandaged his mouth, so we won't getting any of his lip. {{Buttercup}} drags the weapons crate towards the other two, but before she was let a word Bubbles cut into their comms. 

> {{Bubbles}}: I have a new exit point. You'll have to backtrack a little to get to it, which mea-

> {{Buttercup}}: Which means we'll have to fight through some security. We've already seen what they've got in store for us

> {{Bubbles}}: Yes, but you'll be able to dodge most of them

> Brawny: I'll do anything to get out of here even if it means I get shot again

> {{Bubbles}}: This is the faster way to get out. The longer you are in there, the hard it'll be to leave

> {{Buttercup}}. Shit, we'll deal with that. Big guy, hope you're arm is works because you'll still carrying this fucking box. And kid keep that chip deep in your pocket.

Kid growled through his bandages in confirmation. Scrawny thing really can't do much but be a proxy for {{Bubbles}}'s hacks as AmIba Securities tend to employ network isolated systems for enhanced safeguarding. He became half useless once the vanguard's cover was blown.

[Outline: The Crew needed a way out of the facility. {{Bubbles}} mapped out an exit strategy, but more guards on enroute to intercept and recover the assets. The Crew members are forced to push through to escaped. A member is gunned down or captured, but the rest of the crew makes out to the getaway point. Crew leaves in a vehicle when it arrives but are soon chased. The Chase goes on an runs by where {{Blossom}} works. There is a crash, that leaves {{Buttercup}} being the only survivor to be rushed to the hospital, but {{Bubbles}} still tracking her. {{Blossom}} is there to oversee and manager {{Buttercup}}'s care, but is forced to let Buttercup go due to having no coverage. {{Bubbles}} contacts {{Blossom}} to strike a deal in taking care of {{Buttercup}} and she transfers funds to {{Blossom}}. {{Buttercup}} is cared for at {{Blossom}} home and {{Blossom}} gets supplies from her workplace when needed. {{Buttercup}} makes a faster than expected recovery and is back to trying to get the assets from the last deal. {{Blossom}} is shocked that {{Buttercup}} is still determined to get the asset, and offers to join as long as she gets part of the pay out. {{Bubbles}} tracked where the asset went since the crash. The girls make their first plan to work together for the first time.]
