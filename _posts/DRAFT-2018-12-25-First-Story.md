[Outline V2: Vanguard makes it to the first asset without issue. The kid-lookout sets up {{Bubbles}}'s connection to the computer to do a data mine. The rest of the crew sits and waits, even have a conversation of who they are and what they are doing the job for. {{Bubbles}} finds enough data to recreate the schematic asset for an experimental H.I.M weapon. Then Vanguard makes their way down to the basement area to retrieve the other asset. The asset was found to be a create, behind a enclosed alcove within the storage area. {{Buttercup}} and the brawny member entered through the mechanized door after {{Bubbles}} pried it open. The others stayed behind to prepare for the rendezvous. Right when the brawny member touched the crate, the room's door slams and locks behind them with the faculty alarms sounded off. The sudden exposure made everyone tensed up, but they knew what they were got themselves into. Jobs hardly end happily ever after. Although {{Bubbles}} managed to unlock the door, the slam had made it impossible for the motors to budge the halves apart. The door had to have been sabotage as the door violated standard emergency policies. {{Buttercup}} and the brawny member had to pull them apart themselves. This set back gave enough time for guards to come rustling and shouting from the exit way to the rendezvous point. After pulling through the asset's room, the crewed need to backtrack, but were met with a lock security door]

[Outline V1: The crew makes their way pass guards to gain the first assets. They make a safe venture to the office space while {{Bubbles}}, with the help of the kid lookout, hack through the facility’s security, and extract the schematic blueprint onto a storage chip. Then they make their way down to the basement. Security got heavier. The crew were nearly caught to make their way down. Their paced need to slow down until getting into where the weapon crate was to be found. They needed to broke through one final down, but minutes later the alarm sounded off. The the sound shocked through the entire crew, defying their expectations. Guard where heard making their way to the area. ]

[Outline escape: The Crew needed a way out of the facility. {{Bubbles}} mapped out an exit strategy, but more guards on en route to intercept and recover the assets. The Crew members are forced to push through to escaped. A member is gunned down or captured, but the rest of the crew makes out to the getaway point. Crew leaves in a vehicle when it arrives but are soon chased. The Chase goes on an runs by where {{Blossom}} works. There is a crash, that leaves {{Buttercup}} being the only survivor to be rushed to the hospital, but {{Bubbles}} still tracking her. {{Blossom}} is there to manage {{Buttercup}}'s care, but is forced to let Buttercup go due to having no coverage. {{Bubbles}} contacts {{Blossom}} to strike a deal in taking care of {{Buttercup}} and she transfers funds to {{Blossom}}. {{Buttercup}} is cared for at {{Blossom}} home and {{Blossom}} gets supplies from her workplace when needed. They are contacted by {{Bubbles}} who tracked where the asset went since the crash, to make for the job going bad. {{Buttercup}} was still interested to getting the asset. {{Blossom}} offers to join as long as she gets part of the pay out. The girls make their first plan to work together for the first time.]

{{Buttercup}} needed extra cash to prepare for her next match that will happen overseas. The plane tickets themselves will run her more than what she saved from previous matches. But this match is the be all and end all of her her underground career that’ll shoot her towards rockstar status or send her spiraling down like a turd in a toilet. She’ll be in the vanguard team of the operation. The goal? Break into a HIM weapons warehouse to steal developmental schematics and experiment weapons. The hit goes wrong, {{Buttercup}} ends up in the hospital where Blossom works. {{Bubbles}} keeps track on {{Buttercup}} for she feeds responsible for what happened. Hacker is unknown till later.

> {{Buttercup}}: Minimal security, easy break-in points made this hit a done deal according to the contact’s informant. The intel came from a hacker who is joining us to get us by and covering our tracks. I hate relying on some script kiddy behind desk, staring at a screen. I hope his eyes burn from too much exposure after this. Whatever, I’m going to make this a quick job, and get back to training. I’m just at the edge of a new level in the business, but I just need a little bit more money. I’ve gotta make sure this job gets done, no matter what.

>{{Buttercup}}: Hey hackerman.

>Hackerman: My gender does  not matter.

>{{Buttercup}}: Well you matter now. What’s your guess on this job.

>Hacker: We have a high likelihood of making out unscathed.

>{{Buttercup}}: Says the one sitting behind a trash can.

>Hacker: This mission depends on our cohesion. We can’t risk our cooperation over petty grudges.

>{{Buttercup}}: Who said anything about a grudge. I’m the one literally putting my neck on the line while you get to literally sit, point and click.

>Hacker: AmIba security has upped it’s cybersuite packages as of late. It's not easy for me either, but I have a few workarounds.

>{{Buttercup}}: So I guess all we have to do is to not fuck up. You better keep our asses hidden.

>Hacker: I can assure you, you don’t need to worry. I’ll keep you all safe..

>{{Buttercup}}: Sigh. Sure I’ll take your word for what it’s worth..

>Hacker: I brought you good intel.

>{{Buttercup}}: Again, sure.

>Hacker: I promise.

>{{Buttercup}}: If you can keep at least me alive, I'll appreciate that.

Vanguard was dropped off at the point of entry. An entry midway between the office area and the basement where the other asset is housed and escape route is mapped to the rendezvous point. The facility looked heavily guarded from the outside, but the intel suggest this was only a front and the interior will nearly be empty of patrols. The first assets resides on a computer disc somewhere in the office space that was sent and stored there about a month ago.

The crew consisted of a ragtag of characters who all are took on the job to make a quick buck. There’s the wanna be gangster trying to make a name for himself in the city. The hot headed bimbo he brought along might be his girlfriend, and she brought on her own silenced gun. The usual big guy was brawny enough for the requirement to carry the heavy stuff. There's literally some kid the hacker wanted on board as a proxy to access any system that were network isolated. His secondary use was to scout and look out for the crew. Lastly, there's the butch chick only here to realize a dream.

Vanguard entered through the door way, into a hall that is adjacent to the office space they needed to get into. The kid scouted around the corner and located the office room where the schematic asset should be. No cameras in sight as this was a commercial building that only monitored crucial sections of the facility, which the hacker already took care of. The crew made their way six doors down the hallway, keeping their cover from the window opening that lead to the fountain court yard. The intel was solid. No AmIba patrols were seen in nor across the court yard into the window view of the other half of the office space. The first to enter into the office room was the kid as all he needed to do was setup Hacker's data miner. The rest of the crew sat on standby.

>Gangster: I hate this part.

>Brawny: Everyone hates this part.

>Hacker: I prefer this part.

>Gangster Girl: Of course you do.

>Hacker: This will take some time as the schematic was deleted from this desk. This will take longer with the data mine.

>Gangster: You gotta be fucking with me.

>{{Buttercup}}: Be nice everyone one. We need to do all of this to get the pay we're after.

>Brawny: Of course this would happen.

>Kid: Just make this quick. I really want to get out of here.

>Gangster: I'm gonna lay low after all this.

>Gangster Girl: We're going to party after this. You guys are invited.

>Gangster: No, none of you are invited. Just crawl back into the holes you all came from.

>{{Buttercup}}: I don't mind a drink or four.

>Kid: I might finally have enough to get those optic upgrades I've been eyeing. Should cover the operation too!

>Brawny: You'll be better off finishing school, Kid.

>Kid: School? I got expelled to the only one I was qualified for.  At least with this, I'll be make a living.

>{{Buttercup}}: But not a decent one.

>Gangster Girl: I've been where he was. It's better than nothing.

>Hacker: I'm almost done.

>Gangster: How long does it take to just find a fucking file? Hurry the fuck up.

>{{Buttercup}}: Ice the fuck out. It's almost done.

>Brawny: Being that this is H.I.M. tech we're getting, I'm not surprised the effort it takes to get all this done.

>Kid: I've got it all. 

>Hacker: Move onto the next target.

The data miner made a faint beep that confirmed it gathered enough data to recreate the schematics for an experimental H.I.M. weapon. Feeling accomplished, Kid held the storage chip in front of the rest of the crew. It was swiftly snatched by Gangster, who dropped into this coat pocket to suggest that the crew should move on already. Vanguard needed to work their way down to the lower levels. The outline of the plan mapped a stair way at the end of the hall. This led to the basement level where the other asset should be found. It was a large storage room filled with columns of shipments that were soon to be moved to their next destination. This night was the only available time frame to extract this particular asset out of here. Kid did his thing to find where it was located, which was behind a enclosed alcove within the storage area. {{Buttercup}} and Brawny made their way towards the mechanized doors. They couldn't lay a finger as the doors themselves were popped open by Hacker.

>Hacker: I'm saving us the time.

The rest of the vanguard took point in the storage room as {{Buttercup}} and Brawny made their way into the alcove. Nothing out of the ordinary in the room was obvious except a large crate towards the back. Brawny walked up to the crate.  The letters "H.I.M." was clearly etched across the top section of the crate, by the handle. He worked his hand to flip the handle out of its inlay cut out to a standing position to get a firm grip. As soon has he had lifted the crate a millimeter off its position, the mechanized doors loudly slammed right behind {{Buttercup}} with the facility's alarm sounding off.

The sudden exposure caused each member to tense up, but they knew what they got themselves into. Jobs like these hardly have a smooth happy ending. Hacker was able to unlock the doors, but the slam made it impossible to activate the motors to pull the halves apart. The doors had been sabotaged as they've violated standard building policies. The two inside had to pull the halves apart themselves. After pulling the crate though the busted door, vanguard had made their way out towards the exit hallway, past another security doorway with a barely lit exit sign. The hallway opened to a small section of side benches and consoles, but beyond those, it narrowed towards a turn at the end. A turn that brought the crew in full view of the Amiba guards making their way from the opposite end that led to the rendezvous point. The first sight of them was brought with bullets hailing towards vanguard, forcing the crew to backtrack into the storage area. The security doorway had already slammed shut by an AmIba specialist coming for them.

The job soon took a disastrous turn as bullets flew down the corridor, where some were ricocheting off the security door. AmIba guards must have brought in they’re H.I.M. issued tech just for this hit. All it took was one stray ricocheting into the eye socket of the poor bastard carrying the schematic documents. Gangster slumped back against the wall, loosening his grip on his weapon to use the rest of his final moments to maneuver the chip out from his coat pocket but his arm went limp, as did his entire body. The chip was snatch by Kid, who took cover behind the thin corner that narrows the hallway. The vanguard was locked down.

>Gangster Girl: You fucked us! You fucking fucked us!

>Hacker: I can't be blamed for this.

>Brawny: Bullshit. You're the one who got us the intel. What kind of hack you even are?

>Hacker: I dug for the intel, but from anonymous tip.

>Gangster Girl: You took a chance on an anonymous tip!? How can this get any worse with you running your shit scripts.

>Hacker: At least we've secured the cargo. All that needs to be done is for ground team to get out of there.

>{{Buttercup}}: We're fucked here because of you and expect us to make up for your mistake?

>Hacker: Give me time......The security door should be open.

>Kid: But that’s where we came from!

>Hacker: I know. I am going to route you guys a way out, and block access to any pursuing guards.

>{{Buttercup}}: How can we even trust you this time!?

>Hacker: Because I promised.

The full-metal security doors sprung open into the short corridor leading back to storage. It is certainly not the best escape route, as demonstrated by Brawny while carrying the weapon crate. He made a bad gamble after noticing the AmIba guards was on break for a reload, but he followed up too late. He took a shot in the arm holding the crate. It fell silently on its side in the orchestra of gunfire. He was already sluggish being the largest of the bunch, but lucky enough he managed to get to a safe spot in storage, behind the shelves of containers. Gangster Girl was shot down in her attempt to getting pass the security doors. She would have had a chance if she took 3 shots less to her shoulder blades and spine. Her lifeless body skid and rolled barely ahead of the doors, and her gun slid passed the weapon crate.

>Brawny member: They fucking got me! I drop the box!

>{{Buttercup}}: We need that for the full payout. I’m not losing money on this bullshit job.

{{Buttercup}} presses herself against the wall and motions closer the edge but flinches away as streaks of high velocity rounds streamed into the storage area, seemingly missing the crate. The guards were likely ordered not to cause any damage to it and were sure to recapture the asset. It maybe worth more than 100 times their annual paychecks combined. After triple guessing himself, the kid mangled his way towards the storage area, leaving {{Buttercup}} behind. His goofy attempt got his foot caught on the crate, kicking it up laterally on its narrow side and him smacking the floor. It’s rectangular broadside peered back towards the AmIba guards, partially reflecting their movements. The kid crawled from behind the crate, into storage with a small blood trail from a busted lip. {{Buttercup}}  slid flatly behind it to use the crate itself as momentarily cover.

>{{Buttercup}}: Block them off!

The reverberating slam echoed across the corridor and storage room with the neon exit above brightening up before shorting out. Muffled footsteps and clanking from the other side suggest the AmIba guards were attempting to force their through the doors. With this break of action, vanguard gathered around to assets their situation. Two members are wiped out and one and a half are leaking. Brawny's arm didn't get shredded by the AmIba's weapons, even though the shot could have been from a H.I.M. weapon. A quick patch up won't hold up for long, but it'll do for the rest of the night. The kid already bandaged his mouth, so we won't getting any of his lip. {{Buttercup}} dragged the crate along with the extra gun, towards the other two, but before she was let a word, Hacker cut into their comms.

> Hacker: I have a new exit point. You'll have to backtrack a little to get to it, which mea-

> {{Buttercup}}: Which means we'll have to fight through some security. We've already seen what they've got in store for us,

> Hacker: Yes, but you'll be able to dodge most of them,

> Brawny: I'll do anything to get out of here. Even if it means I get shot again,

> Hacker: This is the faster way to get out. The longer you are in there, the harder it'll be to leave. I'll let the driver know,

> {{Buttercup}}. Shit, we'll deal with that. Big guy, hope you're arm still works because you'll still carrying this fucking box. And Kid, keep that chip deep in your pocket.

Kid groaned through his bandages in confirmation. Scrawny thing really can't do much but be a proxy. Now he's half useless for the rest of this job. The clarity of clanking and barking of orders from the exit pushed Vanguard to make their way through the stairwell, back into the hall way. A couple of AmIba were blocking the way towards the other half of the office space where the crew needed to be for their pickup. It was a matter of time AmIba took some causalities of their own as {{Buttercup}} took point to use the silencer to clear them out. This proved to a bad call once the crew were half towards the the exit, AmIba guards linked to the dead bodies, were already pouring through the stairwell and hallway, behind the crew. 

The getaway driver arrived right outside the exit that vanguard was just pulling out of, into the rain. {{Buttercup}} gave covering fire for the others leaving AmIba behind. Kid didn't screw up getting outside and made his way to open up the trucks doors. Luck wasn't so charitable to Brawny when AmIba managed to not miss most of him. AmIba couldn't to not execute him right there for they need to have someone to interrogate. Knowing his odds, Brawny thought it would be better to chuck the crate out in front of {{Buttercup}}.  She rushed to drag the crate into the trunk with one arm and firing back into the exit opening with the other. 

>{{Buttercup}}: Pull off already!

The truck sped off into the city, but not without company. Driver only momentarily lost the AmIba interceptor before arriving at the rendezvous. 

>Hacker: You need to lose them,

>Driver: Shut the fuck up. Was that not obvious to us?!

>{{Buttercup}}: Hacker still got our asses out of there,

>Kid: It was still a shit show back there. We're the ones that got lucky,

>Driver: You think you got anymore luck to spare for the rest of this trip, Kid!?

>Kid: We're just a moving target with this bum Driver at the wheel.

>{{Buttercup}}: I'll pick at them with what I have left. You do your magic, Hacker. Remember, you promised?

>Hacker: . . . OK,

>Hacker: Go here. I have the most control in this area. You'll be going through an underground parkway, where I'll block AmIba from the other side.

>Driver: Corporate district? Shit, you really here to test me, huh!? And it's raining!

The truck's nav brought up a route through the corporate district. Driver took a hard right, skidding out into the main roads. The truck weaved though the other cars and rocked the crew inside. It dodged blinding light of on-coming traffic but AmIba were still dogging them . Traffic got heavier, but driver didn't let off the pedal. Only thing on his mind was go. The next turn had the truck slipped into a 180. Driver had to punch it opposite to where the nav led. He nearly smashed the AmIba interceptor that streaked by. Another turn was taken to correct the crew back on track towards a bridge.  Driver floored it towards bridge, plowing through the intersections except the last. The forgotten interceptor punch into the edge of the truck and AmIba slammed into a concrete wall. The truck whipped and spun off course. The crew got rocked, {{Buttercup} was launched out, and the truck flipped and rolled though the dirt decline to crash into the river. 

>Hacker: . . . Oh no,

>Hacker: . . . But she's still there. I can get some movers.

A nurse stood over {{Buttercup}} reading off her status from her medical tablet. She looked over to {{Buttercup}}, paying most attention to the injuries. The crashed did damage, for there was a cast was on her leg, a sling for her left arm, some patches and IV on her right, and a wrap around her head. The crashed did a its number on her. The nurse turned then back to the tablet and penned some notes on her condition. Another nurse comes into the room. She reviews the medical tablet and performs the same visual inspection on {{Buttercup}}

>Nurse 1: How is her condition improving? Is she still in a coma? Is this replacement acting up already?

>Nurse 2: I never seen this myself.

>Nurse 1: She'll be able to work out of her in a few months at this rate.

>Nurse 2: Fortunately for her, she'll probably have a lower medical bill than most

{{Buttercup}} shook herself up. She looked over to the nurses working as if if were any day of their work week. She lifted up slightly to glance at her slinged arm, the IV in the other, and the restraining belts holder her down. then slumped back down. She let out a sigh out of disappointment or frustration.

[Plot hole: Why wasn't {{Buttercup}} found in a prison instead? She was flung out away from the truck after the crash, landed behind/under some trash that the AmIba couldnt find until the body was found later by bystander]

>{{Buttercup}}: I'm not paying for any of this.

>Nurse 1: Sure you're not. I'm sure you have coverage.

>{{Buttercup}}: Did you even bothered to run a check on me?

>Nurse 1: Well, I haven't yet bu-

>Nurse 2: She has nothing. I just ran the background check. She doesn't even have a job. We're going to have to clear her out of here.

>Nurse 1: Shit. I'm not going to get the commission for this.

>{{Buttercup}}: Alright. Cut me loose already.

The first nurse performed the standard procedure to relieving {{Buttercup}} from the medical bed. While the first nurse prepare the room for the next patient, the second escorted {{Buttercup}} out of the medical office, to the lobby. {{Buttercup}} limped though the doorway while it was held open by nurse's foot as worked her tablet to finalized her dispatch. The tablet buzzed and obscured the dispatch form with an alert that read "If you can take care of this patient, I'll will guarantee you a large instant payment." The surprise made to her question how valid the request. She was made aware that the company will routinely send out phishing attempts, but not as intrusive as this. Another alert came through that read "Check your account now. The rest will be deposited if you take care of her". She quickly checked if this was too good to be true, but there it was,  the deposit. {{Buttercup}} came to the sliding doors until a tug on her shoulder stopped her. 

>Nurse: I can still take care of you.

>{{Buttercup}} pulling away: You're not my type.

>Nurse: That's not what I meant. You can't stay here, but I have some space where you can stay and I'll be able to get the supplies I need from working here.

>{{Buttercup}}: Why are you helping me?

>Nurse: I'm not. But someone else is.  I don't know who really, but they've already convinced me.

>{{Buttercup}}: . . . Hacker.

>Nurse: Who ever they are, they really care about you, if credits are anything to go by. 

>{{Buttercup: Yeah. . . he sorta promised

>{{Blossom}}: I'm {{Blossom}} by the way.

>{{Buttercup}}: . . . {{Buttercup}}

The taxi pulled off to the street after dropping the girls at {{Blossom}}'s place where she lived just outside the corporate district. It surprised {{Buttercup}}. She never thought to see streets empty of trash and drifters. The interior also reflected the higher standard of living as it was filled with quality furniture and equipment. But its size reflected what {{Blossom}} could afford. But close enough to the corporate district made it save enough to stay. Plus, it had space, unobstructed by cartons from takeout, beer boxes or a mix pile of cloths, trash, and parts. Certainly less decorative than what {{Buttercup}} is used to. They went to where {{Buttercup}} will be resting, but before, {{Buttercup}} stop to peer around the corridor to find a bed at the corner of a room. There laid an elderly woman, hooked up to a medical monitor where her heart rate, body temperature and other biometrics were on display.

>{{Buttercup}}: You run your own business here? How much you charging her?

>{{Blossom}}: No. She's my guardian. She came down with something bad a while ago.

>{{Buttercup}}: You're not even related? I don't think I'll ever do something like that for anyone I'm not related to.

>{{Blossom}}: You know you're parents?

>{{Buttercup}}: No...I'm kind of like you. Maybe not as nice as things are here.

>{{Blossom}}: I understand. Well here's where you'll be.

The door opened up to a plain bed room, furnished with the bare necessities. Bed to the wall, study desk with a console built in, TV, and a personal bathroom. {{Buttercup}} sat down by the edge of the bed to remove the sling on her arm. {{Blossom}} attempted to help, but she recognized {{Buttercup}} would rather do it on her own.

>{{Blossom}}: There was a huge crash by the bridge to getting here. Do you know anything about that.

>{{Buttercup}}: I was part of the team.

>{{Blossom}}: The rest of them are dead. Even the AmIba security died to stop you guys. 

>{{Buttercup}} examining her cast: That's how some jobs go.

>{{Blossom}}: This ended worst than most of what I've seen.

>{{Buttercup}}: It was fucking bullshit. Damn thing was a setup. We were so clo- I was so close. We . . . were were working with some fucking hack-

>Hacker abruptly cuts in from the console on the desk: They were working with me.

>{{Blossom}} hesitant to continue the conversation : . . . Who are you?

>Hacker abruptly in view on the TV: . . . I'm {{Bubbles}}

>{{Buttercup}}: That isn't you. Hackers aren't this dumb to show themselves. That's some dude with tits.

>{{Bubbles}}: I'm not some dude. I'm trying to gain your trust.

>{{Buttercup}}: Trust? Don't you remember your the reason for that shitshow back there?

>{{Bubbles}}: . . . I know. I wa-

>{{Buttercup}}: You know jack shit.

>{{Bubbles}}: I was hired right after getting the intel. I didn't think they'll screw you guys over.

>{{Buttercup}}: I almost died out they because of you

>{{Bubbles}}: I didn't need to do this job at all, but I did. And you wouldn't be here if I didn't.

>{{Blossom}}: It makes sense. You were part of that crash, but we found you right out in the lobby, near death.

>{{Buttercup}}: Whatever. What are you here for, then? You want me to thank you, or tell me you're fucking sorry? I've already lost the the chance to getting that money.

>{{Bubbles}}: We can still get the money. I know where the crate went.

>{{Buttercup: . . .Bullshit.

>{{Bubbles}}: The full payout will be more because it'll be only us doing it. I even have your payout from cashing in the schematic.

>{{Buttercup: The job's . . . still open?

{{Buttercup}} sat up on the bed against the wall, her head tilted up to stare at the the lights, then back to the {{Bubbles}} on the slightly fuzzed screen. It was the one thing she thought about even since waking up from the hospital.

>{{Buttercup}}: I'm going finish this for my reasons only. We do this, and we're done working together.

>{{Bubbles}}: OK.

>{{Blossom}}: I'll joining.

>{{Buttercup}}: What are you going to do? Give me first aid?

>{{Bubbles}}: We can use her.

>{{Buttercup}}: We can use another liability, sure.

>{{Blossom}}: I can help you and I can handle myself. Just like you, I'm doing this for my own reasons.
