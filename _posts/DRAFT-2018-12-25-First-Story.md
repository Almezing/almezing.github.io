# How the girls meet. 

[Starts with {{Buttercup}}'s perspective]

{{Buttercup}} needed extra cash to prepare for her next match that will happen overseas. The plane tickets themselves will run her more than what she saved from previous matches. But this match is the be all and end all of her her underground career that’ll shoot her towards rockstar status or send her spiraling down like a turd in a toilet. She’ll be in  the vanguard team of the operation. The goal? Break into a HIM weapons warehouse to steal developmental schematics and experiment weapons. The hit goes wrong, {{Buttercup}} ends up in the hospital where Blossom works. {{Bubbles}} keeps track on {{Buttercup}} for she feeds responsible for what happened. Hacker is unknown till later.

> {{Buttercup}}: Minimal security, easy break-in points made this hit a done deal according to the contact’s informant. The intel came from a hacker who is joining us to get us by and covering our tracks. I hate relying on some dork behind desk, staring at a screen. I hope his eyes burn from too much exposure after this. Whatever, I’m going to make this a quick job, and get back to training. I’m just at the edge of a new level in the slugging business, but I just need a little bit more money. I’ve gotta make sure this job gets done without a hitch.

>{{Buttercup}}: Hey hackerman

>{{Bubbles}}: My gender does  not matter”

>{{Buttercup}}: Well you matter now. What’s your guess on this job

>{{Bubbles}}: We have a high likelihood of making out unscathed

>{{Buttercup}}: Says the one sitting behind a trash can

>{{Bubbles}}: This mission depends on our cohesion. We can’t risk our cooperation over petty grudges

>{{Buttercup}}: Who said anything about a grudge. I’m the one literally putting my neck on the line while you get to literally sit, point and click

>{{Bubbles}}: AmIba security has upped it’s cybersuite packages as of late, and I have not found any workarounds just yet

>{{Buttercup}}: All the more reason for me to make sure I don’t fuck up, and do keep our asses hidden

>{{Bubbles}}: I can assure you, you don’t need to worry. I’ll keep you all safe. Especially you if you like.

>{{Buttercup}}: Sigh. Sure I’ll take your special good luck charm for what it’s worth.

>{{Bubbles}}: I brought you good intel

>{{Buttercup}}: Again, sure

>{{Bubbles}}: I promise

Vanguard arrived at the point of entry. This side entry was found to be the quickest but safest way into where the assets were being held. An entry midway between office area and basement where the other asset is housed and escape route is mapped to the rendezvous point. The facility looked heavily guarded from the outside, but the intel suggest this was only a front and the interior will nearly be empty of patrols. The first assets resides on a computer desk somewhere in the office space. It was sent and stored there about a week ago. It may have been deleted after sitting for so long, but traces of it can be recovered. 
Vanguard  was dropped off at the point of entry. This side entry was found to be the quickest but safest way into where the assets were being held. An entry midway between office area and basement where the other asset is housed and escape route is mapped to the rendezvous point. The facility looked heavily guarded from the outside, but the intel suggest this was only a front and the interior will nearly be empty of patrols. The first assets resides on a computer disc somewhere in the office space. It was sent and stored there about a month ago. It may have been deleted after sitting for so long, but traces of it can be recovered.

The crew consisted of a ragtag of characters who all are took on the job to make a quick buck. There’s the wanna be gangster trying to make a name for himself in the city. The hot headed bimbo he brought along might be his girlfriend, and she brought on some extra gear. The usual big guy brawny enough for the requirement to carry the heavy stuff. There's literally some kid the hacker dude wanted on board as a proxy for him to access any consoles that were network isolated. His secondary use is to scout and look out for the crew.  Lastly, there's the butch chick only here to realize a dream.

Vanguard entered through the door way, into a hall that is adjacent to the office space they needed to get into. The kid scouted around the corner and located the office room where the schematic asset should be. No cameras in sight as this was a commercial building that only monitored crucial sections of the facility. The crew made their way six doors down the hallway, keeping their cover from the window opening that lead to the fountain court yard. The intel was solid. No AmIba patrols were seen in nor across the court yard into the window view of the other half of the office space. The first to enter into the office room was the kid. All he needed to do was setup the hackers' connection to the desk to start the extraction. The rest of the crew sat on standby.

>Gangster: "I hate this part"

>Brawny: "Everyone hates this part"

>Hacker: "I prefer this part"

>Gangster Girl: "Of course you do"

>Hacker: "This will take some time as the schematic was deleted from this desk. I need to do a data mine"

>Gangster: "You gotta be fucking with me"

>{{Buttercup}}: "Be nice everyone one. We need to do all of this to get the pay we're after"

>Brawny: "Of course this would happen"

>Kid: "Just make this quick. I really want to get out of here"

>Gangster: "I'm gonna lay low after all this"

>Gangster Girl: "We're going to party after this. You guys are invited"

>Gangster: "No, none of you are invited. Just crawl back into the holes you all came from"

>{{Buttercup}}: "I don't mind a drink or four"

>Kid: "I might finally have enough to get those optic upgrades I've been eyeing. Should cover the operation too!"

>Brawny: "You'll be better off finishing school, Kid"

>Kid: "School? I got expelled to the only one I was qualified for.  At least with this, I'll be make a living."

>{{Buttercup}}: "But not a decent one"

>Gangster Girl: "I've been where he was. It's better than nothing."

>Hacker: "I'm almost done"

>Gangster: "How long does it take to just find a fucking file? Hurry the fuck up"

>{{Buttercup}}: "Chill the fuck out. It's almost done"

>Brawny: "Being that this is H.I.M. tech we're getting, I'm no surprised the effort it takes to get all this done"

>Hacker: "I've got it all. Move onto the next target"

Hacker gathered enough data to recreate the schematics for an experimental H.I.M. weapon. Kid held the storage chip housing the blueprint in front of the rest of the crew. It was swiftly snatched by Gangster who dropped into this coat pocket to suggest that every should quickly move on. The crew needed to work their way down to the lower levels. The outline of the plan mapped a stair way at the end of the hall. This led to the basement level where the other asset should be found. It was a large storage room filled with columns of shipments that were soon to be moved to their next destination. This night was the only available time frame to extract the asset out of here. Kid did his thing to find where it was located, which was behind a enclosed alcove within the storage area. {{Buttercup}} and Brawny made their way towards the mechanized doors. They couldn't lay a finger as the doors themselves were popped open by Hacker.

>Hacker: "I'm saving you the time"

The rest of the vanguard took point in the storage room as {{Buttercup}} and Brawny made their way into the alcove. Nothing out of the ordinary in the room was obvious except a large crate towards the back. Brawny walked up to the crate.  The letters "H.I.M." was clearly etched across the top section of the crate, by the handle. He worked his hand to flip the handle out of its inlay cut out to a standing position to get a firm grip. As soon has he had lifted the crate a millimeter off its position, the mechanized doors loudly slammed right behind {{Buttercup}} with the facility alarm sounding off.

The sudden exposure caused each member to tense up, but they knew what they got themselves into. Jobs like these hardly end smoothly and happily. Hacker was able to unlock the doors, but the slam made it impossible to activate the motors to pull the halves apart. The doors had been sabotaged as they've violated standard building policies. The two inside had to pull them apart themselves. The ordeal gave enough time for AmIba guards to come rustling and shouting from the exit way leading to the rendezvous point. AmIba gathered faster than what the crew was prepared. The first sight of them was brought bullets hailing towards their position. Vanguard had to make their way to the opposite end of the storage room leading to the stair way. 

[Outline V2: Vanguard makes it to the first asset without issue. The kid-lookout sets up {{Bubbles}}'s connection to the computer to do a data mine. The rest of the crew sits and waits, even have a conversation of who they are and what they are doing the job for. {{Bubbles}} finds enough data to recreate the schematic asset for an experimental H.I.M weapon. Then Vanguard makes their way down to the basement area to retrieve the other asset. The asset was found to be a create, behind a enclosed alcove within the storage area. {{Buttercup}} and the brawny member entered through the mechanized door after {{Bubbles}} pryed it open. The others stayed behind to prepare for the rendezvous. Right when the brawy member touched the crate, the room's door slams and locks behind them with the facilty alarms sounded off. The sudden exposure made everyone tensed up, but they knew what they were got themselves into. Jobs hardly end happily ever after. Although {{Bubbles}} mananged to unlock the door, the slam had made it impossible for the motors to budge the halfs apart. The door had to have been sabotage as the door violated standard emegency policies. {{Buttercup}} and the brawy member had to pull them apart themselves. This set back gave enough time for guards to come rustling and shouting from the exit way to the rendezvou point. After pulling through the asset's room, the crewed need to backtrack, but were met with a lock security door]

[Outline V1: The crew makes their way pass guards to gain the first assets. They make a safe venture to the office space while {{Bubbles}}, with the help of the kid lookout, hack through the facility’s security, and extract the schematic blueprint onto a storage chip. Then they make their way down to the basement. Security got heavier. The crew were nearly caught to make their way down. Their paced need to slow down until getting into where the weapon crate was to be found. They needed to broke through one final down, but minutes later the alarm sounded off. The the sound shocked through the entire crew, defying their expectations. Guard where heard making their way to the area. ]

The job soon took a disasterous turn. Bullets are flying down the corridor. Some are ricocheting off the security door at the back. AmIba guards must have brought in they’re H.I.M. issued tech just for this hit. All it took was one stray ricocheting into the eye socket of the poor bastard carrying the schematic documents. The crew member slumped back against the wall, loosening his grip on his weapon to use the rest of his final moments to maneuver the memory card out from his coat pocket but his arm went limp, as did his entire body. The chip was snatch by the kid-lookout hiding behind the thin corner that narrows the hallway, where the rest of the vanguard team were locked down.

[Will need to describe the area better]

>Buttercup: You fucked us! You fucking fucked us!

>{{Bubbles}}: I can't be blamed for this

>{{Buttercup}}: Bullshit. You're the one who got us the intel. What kind of hack you even are?

>{{Bubbles}}: I dug for the intel, but from on anonymous tip

>{{Buttercup}}: You took a chance on an anonymous tip!? How can this get any worse with you running your shit scripts.

>{{Bubbles}}: At least we've secured the cargo. All that needs to be done is for ground team to get out of there

>{{Buttercup}}: We're fucked here because of you and expect us to make up for your mistake?

>{{Bubbles}}: Give me time......The security door should be open

>{{Buttercup}}: But that’s where we came from!

>{{Bubbles}}: I know. I am going to route you guys a way out, and block access to any pursuing guards.

>{{Buttercup}}: How can I even trust you!?

>{{Bubbles}}: Became I promised.

The full-metal security doors instantly sprung open into the short corridor leading back to storage. It is certainly not the best escape route, as demonstrated by another crew member designated to carrying the large experimental weapon crate. He made a bad gamble when noticing the AmIba guards was on break for a reload, but he followed up too late. He took a shot in the arm holding the crate. The dropped crate was hardly audible in the orchestra of gunfire. He was already sluggish for being the brawny build in the bunch, but lucky enough he managed to get to a safe spot in storage, behind the shelves of containers. A second member was shot down in her attempt to get pass the security doors. She would have had a chance if she took 3 shots less to her shoulder blades and spine. Her lifeless body skid and rolled past the doors but barely inches besides the weapon crate.

>Brawny member: They fucking got me! I drop the box!

>{{Buttercup}}: We need that for the full payout. I’m not losing money on this bullshit job.

{{Buttercup}} presses herself against the wall and motions closer the edge but flinches away as streaks of high velocity rounds whiz pass into the storage area, seemingly missing the crate. The guards were likely ordered not to cause any damage to it and were sure to recapture the asset. It maybe worth more than 100 times their annual paychecks combined. After triple guessing himself, the kid-lookout mangled his way towards the storage containers, leaving {{Buttercup}} behind. His goofy attempt got his foot caught on the crate, kicking it up laterally on its narrow side and him smacking the floor. It’s rectangular broadside peered back towards the AmIba guards, partially reflecting their movements. The kid crawled from behind the crate, into storage with a small blood trail from a busted lip. {{Buttercup}} used the same idea to use the crate itself as momentarily cover after sliding flatley behind it.

>{{Buttercup}}: Block them off!

The reverberating slam echoed across the corridor and storage room with the neon exit above brightening up before shorting out. Muffled footsteps, clanking and chatter from the other side suggest the AmIba guards are attempting to force their through the doors. With this break of action, the crew gathered around to assets their situation. 2 members are wiped and 1 and a half are leaking. The brawny member arm didn't get shredded by the AmIba's weapons, even though the shot could have been from a H.I.M weapon. A quick patch up won't hold up from long, but it'll do for the rest of the night. The kid already bandaged his mouth, so we won't getting any of his lip. {{Buttercup}} drags the weapons crate towards the other two, but before she was let a word Bubbles cut into their comms. 

> {{Bubbles}}: I have a new exit point. You'll have to backtrack a little to get to it, which mea-

> {{Buttercup}}: Which means we'll have to fight through some security. We've already seen what they've got in store for us

> {{Bubbles}}: Yes, but you'll be able to dodge most of them

> Brawny: I'll do anything to get out of here even if it means I get shot again

> {{Bubbles}}: This is the faster way to get out. The longer you are in there, the hard it'll be to leave

> {{Buttercup}}. Shit, we'll deal with that. Big guy, hope you're arm is works because you'll still carrying this fucking box. And kid keep that chip deep in your pocket.

Kid growled through his bandages in confirmation. Scrawny thing really can't do much but be a proxy for {{Bubbles}}'s hacks as AmIba Securities tend to employ network isolated systems for enhanced safeguarding. He became half useless once the vanguard's cover was blown.

[Outline: The Crew needed a way out of the facility. {{Bubbles}} mapped out an exit strategy, but more guards on enroute to intercept and recover the assets. The Crew members are forced to push through to escaped. A member is gunned down or captured, but the rest of the crew makes out to the getaway point. Crew leaves in a vehicle when it arrives but are soon chased. The Chase goes on an runs by where {{Blossom}} works. There is a crash, that leaves {{Buttercup}} being the only survivor to be rushed to the hospital, but {{Bubbles}} still tracking her. {{Blossom}} is there to oversee and manager {{Buttercup}}'s care, but is forced to let Buttercup go due to having no coverage. {{Bubbles}} contacts {{Blossom}} to strike a deal in taking care of {{Buttercup}} and she transfers funds to {{Blossom}}. {{Buttercup}} is cared for at {{Blossom}} home and {{Blossom}} gets supplies from her workplace when needed. {{Buttercup}} makes a faster than expected recovery and is back to trying to get the assets from the last deal. {{Blossom}} is shocked that {{Buttercup}} is still determined to get the asset, and offers to join as long as she gets part of the pay out. {{Bubbles}} tracked where the asset went since the crash. The girls make their first plan to work together for the first time.]
