### Grinders (Represents Gangreene Gang):
Auto-Biohacking group consisting of zealous members who are brutal in their conduct. The process of induction for new members is done by completing extremely difficult tasks to the point of suicide of martyrdom status. This is the only way members can show that they truly believe they are to be accepted. The tasks makes it almost a certainty these new members return with life threatening wounds and missing limbs. Some do not return, leaving abandonment or death as the only valid assumptions. Once accepted, members are administered a secret injection, not known to the outside, thatâ€™ll force their body to regenerate damage parts, but the healing process leaves the affect area with green pigment. Some members try to improve themselves with body parts of anyone they want, most times by force.

Buttercup - "Only the Strong may enter" 

Read the sign hung by a rusted clamp nailed above the eroded entry of the old car factory. Abandoned by a defunct automobile manufacturer years ago, the place became a home the homeless, criminal and rejected. But most importantly, the area is run by the Grinders. Although they are not a large group, they are as brutal as any gang running around the city. Rumors say they'll take body parts from who ever they get their hands on. 

Buttercup made her way passed the sign, and several vagrants. Even though the area was provide power for basic lights and equipment, they were found huddling near a garbage fire. She noticed the flame burned with a slight rainbow effect. Vagrants must have scrounge anything to stoke flame. She found the place where her tip would lead her, a heavy metal door blocking the basement section. One hard knock to get the door open, said her tip. She kicks the door. The guard on the other side barked though.

Watcher guard - "You better have a good reason to bother us, or we'll take every you got. Even you."

Buttercup - "I heard there's a gang out here. I wanna join"

Watcher guard - "Join the pile, sure. Not after we use you up first" 

Buttercup - "Open the fucking door already"

Rust shook off the door once it began to slide right into wall. Green hands with missing nails held and pushed the doors edge barely disappeared behind the wall, and out stepped the guard. He was massive but the muscles were bulging out of proportion. His right arm was larger than the left, but his left hand was large than the right. He had a jigsaw of body parts that suggested he was a senior member. 

Watcher guard - "I imagined you'd be shorter"

Buttercup - "Yeah, big shocker. You gonna let me in?"

Watcher guard - "Step right in"

The guard step aside as Buttercup moved passed him. The door slid shut and the guard trailed behind her. The path was barely lit by the few emergency lamps above. Once towards the end, a space opened up to the gangs internal operations, and they had piles. Piles of hardware stolen from who knows where. Piles of garbage and junk scraped from the factory and surrounding area. But worst, piles of rotting flesh that was salvaged from those unfortunate enough to have met such an end. 

Watcher guard - "Walk towards the left end corner. He'll be there"

Buttercup - "But who am I looking for?"

The guard ignored her. She turned towards the organized land fill and watched how the members were processing the hardware and wetware like jigsawed disassembly workers. There were no live victims to be seen. Everything they touch was already powered down and lifeless. Remembering where section the guard pointed, Buttercup motioned down further into the grinder. She found the spot and a several members around enclosed room they were seemingly guarding. A slender build member noticed her approach. 

Buttercup - "Word out there said you're the one I talk to"

Ace - "We got a new one coming. I'm Ace."

Buttercup - "I want in"

Ace - "Of course you want in. No one comes in here, sees all this madness and thinks "I've made a mistake". At least, no one leaves mistaken."

Buttercup - "So what I gotta do?"

Ace - "Waht you gotta do is get in there, that room, and prove yourself.

His greenish finger pointed towards the enclosed room.
