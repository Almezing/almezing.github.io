### Grinders (Represents Gangreene Gang):
Auto-Biohacking group consisting of zealous members who are brutal in their conduct. The process of induction for new members is done by completing extremely difficult tasks to the point of suicide of martyrdom status. This is the only way members can show that they truly believe they are to be accepted. The tasks makes it almost a certainty these new members return with life threatening wounds and missing limbs. Some do not return, leaving abandonment or death as the only valid assumptions. Once accepted, members are administered a secret injection, not known to the outside, thatâ€™ll force their body to regenerate damage parts, but the healing process leaves the affect area with green pigment. Some members try to improve themselves with body parts of anyone they want, most times by force.

Buttercup - "Only the Strong may enter" 

Read the sign hung by a rusted clamp nailed above the eroded entry of the old car factory. Abandoned by a defunct automobile manufacturer years ago, the place became a home for the homeless, criminal and rejected. But most importantly, the area is run by the Grinders. Although they are not a large group, they are as brutal as any gang running around the city. Rumors say they'll take body parts from whoever they get their hands on. 

Buttercup made her way passed the sign and several vagrants. Even though the area managed to get power for basic lights and equipment, vagrants were found huddling near a garbage fire. She noticed the flame burned with a slight rainbow effect. Vagrants must have scrounge anything to stoke flame. She found the place where her tip lead her; a heavy metal door blocking the basement section of the factory. One hard knock was all that was needed to get the door open, said her tip. She kicks the door. The guard on the other side barked though.

Watcher guard - "You better have a good reason to bother us, or we'll take every you got. Even you."

Buttercup - "I heard there's a gang out here. I wanna join"

Watcher guard - "Join the pile, sure. Not after we use you up first" 

Buttercup - "Open the fucking door already"

Rust shook off the door once it began to slide right into wall. Green hands with a couple of fingers missing nails gripped and pushed the slab's edge barely behind the wall, and out stepped the guard. He was massive with the muscles bulging out of proportion. His right arm was larger and greener than the left, but his left hand was large and greener than his right. It was impossible to tell what was originally him and what was acquired. He had a jigsaw of body parts that suggested he was a senior member. 

Watcher guard - "I thought you'd be shorter"

Buttercup - "Yeah, big shocker. You gonna let me in?"

Watcher guard - "Step right in"

The guard stepped aside as Buttercup moved passed him. He slid the door shut and trailed behind her. The path was barely lit by the few emergency lamps above. Once at the end of the hall, a space opened up to the gangs internal operations, piles and all. Piles of hardware stolen from who knows where. Piles of garbage and junk scraped from the factory and surrounding area. But worst, piles of rotting flesh that was salvaged from those unfortunate enough to have met such an end. 

Watcher guard - "Walk towards the left end corner. He'll be there"

Buttercup - "But who am I looking for?"

The guard ignored her. She turned towards the organized land fill and watched how the members were processing the hardware and wetware like jigsawed disassembly workers. There were no live victims to be seen. Everything they touch was already powered down and lifeless. Remembering the section the guard pointed towards, Buttercup motioned down further into the meat grinder. She found the spot and a several members around an enclosed room they were seemingly guarding. A slender build member noticed her approach. 

Buttercup - "Guard up front said you're the one I talk to"

Ace - "We got a new one coming, boys. I'm Ace."

Buttercup - "I want in"

Ace - "Of course you want in. No one comes in here, sees all this madness and thinks "I've made a mistake". At least, no one leaves mistaken."

Buttercup - "So what I gotta do?"

Ace - "What you gotta do is get in there, that room, and prove yourself.

His greenish finger pointed towards the enclosed room.
