The alarm is going to hit 5:30 soon. I have to get up for the run. It takes me 28 minutes to finish with 3 minutes to get back into my room, 15 to wash up and another 15 to get ready for the haul to get to work. I can do things better to get a better time, but thatâ€™ll be another day to test. This routine works well enough. This week is where the new patients are sent in. I kind of like seeing the new faces. Gives me something to look forward to. I already have this month covered, but with the new pay installment also coming in, I might have to do that job again to cover the cost. She deserve to see another day. The alarm is about to go off.

She rose and slipped out of the bed and sheets to immediately put on her goto gear for anything that outside. Before she made it to the door, her phone ranged in her pocket. "BLOCKED NUMBER"  it read across its small screen of a few hundrud pixels. 

"Just stop already. I'm not going back" She muttered as she muted the device. "I have too many things to worry able anyway". She made her way through the door outside the house, onto the sidewalk of her darkly light street. She looked around the area out of instinct, took a deep breahth, and start her morning run around the block. It's a luxury her neighborhood was save enough at this time and luminosity to run out oh her own. Any place outside the corporate area would considered too dangerous for most, but it wouldn't matter for Blossom. She'll rather skip the run to avoid any delays in her day.
