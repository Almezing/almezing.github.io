The alarm is going to hit 5:30 soon. I have to get up for the run. It takes me 28 minutes to finish with 3 minutes to get back into my room, 15 to wash up and another 15 to get ready for the haul to get to work. I can do things better to get a better time, but thatâ€™ll be another day to test. This routine works well enough. This week is where the new patients are sent in. I kind of like seeing the new faces. Gives me something to look forward to. I already have this month covered, but with the new pay installment also coming in, I might have to do that job again to cover the cost. She deserve to see another day. The alarm is about to go off.
